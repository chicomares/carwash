  <p class="w3-center"><em>In the last four Brazilian general elections, 21% of the campaign donations came from companies investigated by the Car Wash Operation</em></p>
  <p>Companies implicated in a massive corruption investigation were responsible for 21% of all the campaign donations for general elections in Brazil since 2002. In total, a group of 136 companies contributed with 2.5 billion reais (£600 million) out of a total 16.3 billion (£3.9 billion) – values adjusted by the inflation rate of the period. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, a considerable proportion of this money comes from illegal sources. Instead of bribing politicians directly, some of these companies made contributions to their campaigns as a means to launder the money. The CEOs of two of the biggest campaign contributors in the country, Marcelo Odebrecht, from <a href="http://www.odebrecht.com/en/home" target="_blank">Odebrecht</a>, and Joesley Batista, from <a href="http://jbsglobal.co.uk/" target="_blank">JBS</a>, admitted in court that this was a common practice. They’re, respectively, the largest engineering and the largest meatpacking company in Brazil. </p>
<p>These numbers come from the <a href=" http://english.tse.jus.br/" target="_blank">TSE (Brazil’s Supreme Electoral Court)</a> database, and refer only to <a href="http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais" target="_blank"> official contributions</a> to the 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 state and national elections candidates. </p>
<p>Of the top 10 campaign contributors of the last four elections, only three (the ones marked in blue) are not currently being investigated by the so-called <a href=" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/brazil-operation-car-wash-is-this-the-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-history" target="_blank">Car Wash Operation</a>, a corruption investigation that involves some of the highest-ranking politicians and the largest corporations in Brazil. </p>

<h3>The Operation</h3>
      <p>Run by the Federal Police and the Federal Attorney’s Office, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-39576896" target="_blank">Car Wash Operation</a> – named after a car wash used for money laundering – revealed a massive web of corruption in the country. The operation started in 2014 and, in the beginning, targeted a group of doleiros (black market money dealers). </p>

      <p><b><i class="fa fa-user w3-margin-right"></i>An end in sight?</b></p><br>
	  <p>Is there any end in sight for the political crisis in Brazil? And what comes after all this? We asked political scientist David Fleischer, from UnB, what are his predictions for the future of politics in Brazil.</p>

<p>Soon enough, though, the investigators discovered that the main doleiro, Alberto Youssef, used his network to launder money for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e8b0e28-f728-11e5-803c-d27c7117d132" target="_blank">Paulo Roberto Costa</a>, director of Petrobras, a state-run oil company – who had corrupt dealings with politicians and Petrobras contractors. </p>
<p>Costa’s imprisonment had a domino effect. Since then, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-former-house-speaker-eduardo-cunha-arrested-in-corruption-investigation-1476895613" target="_blank">top rank politicians</a> from all the main political parties, including four former presidents, and some of the largest companies in Brazil have been investigated. </p>
<p>Many have been arrested, including Petrobras directors, politicians and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/business/international/brazil-arrests-head-ofodebrecht-in-petrobras-scandal.html" target="_blank">company executives</a>. It also affected the impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff – although that was not the cause of it, the political instability generated by the investigation was decisive for her fall. Last year, the investigation reached current president <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/18/americas/brazil-temer-bribery-allegations/index.html" target="_blank">Michel Temer</a> (former Rousseff’s vice-president, <a href="#jbs">see more below</a>). </p>
   
    </div></div>
<p>Amongst the discoveries made by the Federal Police, they found out that many of the campaign contributions were actually bribes. It worked like this: a company would demand a favour from a congressman, or other high-ranking politician. Instead of giving him the money directly, they would make a legal, registered donation to his re-election campaign. </p>
<p>It is impossible, though, to estimate how much of this 2.5 billion reais (£600 million) spent in a twelve-year period had illegal sources. So far, all we know is that at least 400 million reais (£96 million) “donated” by JBS, were confirmed to be direct bribes. Other companies, such as Odebrecht, confirmed to adopt this practice, but did not disclose exactly how much of their donations were bribes. </p>
<h3>An expression of the problem</h3>
<p>According to economist Sérgio Lazzarini, author of the book Capitalismo de Laços (Connection Capitalism), the Car Wash Operation is an expression of a problem within the Brazilian political and economic system. “The public sector opens opportunities to the private sector – e. g. credit and public concessions. The private sector, then, wants to connect with the government to be an privileged position”, he says. </p>
<p> “The main mechanism to achieve this connection over the years is supporting political campaigns. Nonetheless, in many cases, what actually happens is pure bribery – they pay politicians to open the doors of the government.” </p>
<p>David Fleischer, a political scientist who lectures at the National University of Brasília (UnB), these large campaign contributors profited from their donations. “The company has an advantage against their competitors. Many of them, for instance, gained contracts with Petrobras, or were able to improve their contracts after making these donations”, he says, referring to the investigations. </p>

Lula is its undisputed leader and recognizable face – for better and for worse. After Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment, became the main opposition party. Somewhat similar to the Labour Party. </p><span class="read-more-target"><p><b>PSDB</b> (Brazilian Social Democratic Party): Despite its name and origins, it’s currently a center-right party. Governed the country from 1995 to 2002, with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and was the main opposition party in the PT era. Now, supports Temer. </p>
<p><b>PMDB</b> (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party): President Michel Temer’s party. It can be described as a vast coalition of regional “caciques” (as political leaders are often referred to in Brazil), spanning from the extreme left to the religious right. From 2006 on, supported Lula and Rousseff (until days before the impeachment), Lula and Cardoso. </p>
<p><b>PSB</b> (Brazilian Socialist Party): Centre-left party, was one of PT’s core allies, but left the coalition in 2013. The following year, after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/brazil-presidential-candidate-eduardo-campos-killed-in-plane-crash" target="_blank">tragic death</a> of Eduardo Campos, Marina Silva became a presidential candidate representing the party – but she soon left to form her own Rede Sustentabilidade. Supported Temer at the beginning, but became an opposition party this year. </p>
<p><b>PP</b> (Progressive Party): Despite its name, it’s one of the main right-wing parties in Brazil. Nonetheless, it was part of Lula and Rousseff’s coalition – until days before the impeachment. Currently supports Temer. </p>
<p><b>DEM</b> (Democrats): Also a right-wing party. Was PSDB main ally during their tenure, and radically opposed PT. Now supports Temer. </p>
<p><b>PSD</b> (Social Democratic Party): Founded in 2011, it was described by its leader, Gilberto Kassab, as “not a right-wing, nor a left-wing, nor a centre party”. Essentially, it supports the government – whichever it is. Also ditched Rousseff at the last minute, also supports Temer. </p>
<p><b>PR</b> (Republic Party): Formerly known as the liberal party, was the first conservative party to make an alliance with the PT and Lula, before the 2002 election. Also ditched Rousseff at the last minute, also supports Temer. </p>
<p><b>PDT</b> (“Trabalhista” Democratic Party): Centre-left party identified with “trabalhismo” (which can be roughly define as a mixture of nationalism, populism and social democracy, very popular in Latin America). Supported PT from the beginning to the end of the tenure, now is an opposition party. </p>
<p><b>PC do B</b> (Communist Party from Brazil): Left-wing party, but not exactly communist anymore. Often described as an extension of PT. Currently on opposition. </p>
<p><b>PPS</b> (Popular Socialist Party): Used to be Brazil’s largest communist party. Nonetheless, it took a turn to the right in the 90s and became a moderate centre party. Although initially part of the coalition, stopped supporting Lula and the PT after political scandals in 2005. Now it’s allied with Temer. </p>

<p>Of course, some received much more money than others. PT, former presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff’s party, earned 789 million reais (£189 million) during this period. The main opposition party from 2003 to 2016, PSDB was also favoured by these companies: they received 516 million reais (£123 million). </p>
<p>Besides being the two most important parties in Brazilian politics during that period, the fact that they both released viable presidential candidates in all four elections also contributed to the high amount of donations received in this period – compared to, for example, PMDB, with a similar number of congressmen and viable candidates for state governments, but received “only” 385 million reais (£92 million). </p>

<p>From year to year, the cost of the campaign rose significantly. In 2002, all the candidates earned, together, 1.4 billion reais (£335 million). 12 years later, this figure rose to 4.4 billion (£1 billion) – the values were adjusted to the inflation. </p>
<p>What seems more surprising is that, during this twelve year span, the amount of money spent by the Car Wash investigated companies increased more than tenfold – from 99 million reais (£24 million) to 1.2 billion reais (£287 million). </p>

</div> <p>According to Emerson Urizzi Cervi, professor at the Political Sciences department of Federal University of Paraná, it was not the cost of the campaigns that increased, but the volume of contribution from large companies. </p>
<p> “Large companies started to use campaign donations to strengthen their ties to the political elite”, says Cervi. According to him, these large contributors tend to focus their donations on presidential elections. “The political campaigns got more expensive, but not in a homogeneous way”. </p>

  <p>Due to changes in the rules by the TSE, the 2014 election accountability report allows us to see with much more detail the dynamics of campaign spending in Brazil. In previous years, we could see how much each candidate received and how much each donor spent, but since they could funnel their donations through parties, it was impossible to say how much money each company donated to each candidate. </p>

  <div class="read-more-wrap"><p><b>General Elections in Brazil: how do they work?</b></p><br>
	  <p>The political system in Brazil is somewhat similar to the United States. The executive power is represented by an elected president, and the legislative power is the Congress – divided in the Federal Chamber, equivalent to the Chamber of Representatives, and the Senate. The states have their own elected governments and their own parliaments – called the State Assemblies (except in Brasília, where it’s called District Assembly).</p>
	  <span class="read-more-target"><p>Every four years, in October, there are general elections – in which all the federal and state offices, except for part of the Senate, are renewed. Presidents and governors are elected directly, in a two-round system – if no one reaches more than 50% of the votes, the two best qualified go to the second round. Whoever gets more votes, wins. They can only serve two consecutive terms. </p>
<p>Senators are also elected by direct popular vote, but the elections are slightly different. Every state, regardless of population, has 3 seats at the senate. Senators have an eight-year term, unlike everyone else. In some elections (such as 2006 and 2014), one senator is elected by state, in a majority one-round system. In others (such as 2010 and 2018), the two best qualified are elected. </p>
<p>Deputy elections are far more complicated. It’s called “proportional representation with open lists”. It means that the seats are allocated proportionally to the parties’ overall votes in a particular state, but the deputies themselves are chosen by direct popular vote. </p>
<p>It works like this. When a voter gets to the poll, he can either vote for a party or a candidate – and, automatically, to this candidate’s party. If a party gets 5 seats, the five candidates of that party with the most votes get to the Congress/Assembly, and the rest become stand-ins. </p>

<p>1,627 candidates were elected for five different offices in that year: 1,059 state/district deputies, 513 federal deputies, 27 senators, 27 governors and, of course, the president. 1,051 of them received donations from companies investigated by the Car Wash operation. </p>
<p>As in previous years, almost all political groups received donations from these companies – the exceptions are small, extreme left-wing parties. Nonetheless, the amount of money and the proportion of it vary greatly from group to group. </p>
<p>Rousseff and Lula’s party, PT received 424 million in total – 44% of their earnings. PSDB, the main opposition party, was ranked second in absolute numbers – 212 million reais (£51 million) – and third in proportion – 29%.</p>

Of all elected governors, only one did not receive donations from investigated companies. In the federal Congress, 20 elected senators (75%) and 394 federal deputies (76%) were in the companies’ payroll. 610 state or district deputies (57%), the lowest rank offices on that election, received donations. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, incumbent candidate Rousseff, who had the most expensive campaign during those elections, was the main beneficiary of the donations. She received 219 million reais (£52 million) from these companies, 62% of her campaign total earnings. Her main opponent, senator Aécio Neves, received 99 million (£24 million, 41% of his campaign’s earnings). </p>
<p>In both camps, JBS, the meatpacking giant, was the main contributor – see more on the following section. Andrade Gutierrez and OAS also made meaningful contributions to Rousseff’s re-election bid. Both companies were part of a cartel that controlled contracts with Petrobras and the federal government. In Neves’ case, it was Andrade Gutierrez and Odebrecht – a company that, at the time of the election, was already being investigated for corruption. </p>

  <p>Meatpacking giant JBS sits on the top of the list of campaign contributors over the last 12 years, having spent 453 million reais (£108 million) since 2006. The amount of money the company donated is remarkable, to say the least: it’s more than Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Correia, respectively second and third on the ranking, combined. </p>
<p>If you are following the latest developments in Brazilian politics, the name probably rang a bell. JBS is on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/19/brazil-president-michel-temer-corruption-conspiracy-accusation" target="_blank">the eye of the hurricane</a> of the last chapter of the scandal parade that Brasília has become over the last three years. </p>
<p>A quick recap: Joesley Batista, JBS’s CEO, was being investigated by the Car Wash Operation, and <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/01/jbs-parent-corruption-probes-brazil/" target="_blank">agreed to co-operate with the prosecutors</a>. On March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/18/brazil-explosive-recordings-implicate-president-michel-temer-in-bribery" target="_blank">he recorded a conversation with Brazil president Michel Temer</a>, in which they discussed paying a monthly allowance to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/brazil-arrests-key-figure-rousseff-impeachment-161019171830208.html" target="_blank">Eduardo Cunha</a>, a former politician currently in prison, for his silence. Temer claims the tape has been doctored. </p>
<p>Batista also paid 500,000 reais (£120,000) illegally to one of Temer’s key assistants, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, and recorded Aécio Neves, senator and defeated opposition presidential candidate in 2014, asking for bribes. Finally, JBS’s CEO stated that former presidents Luís Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff had personal accounts in Switzerland to receive illegal payments from the company. </p>
<p>As we mentioned before, the CEO also admitted that the vast majority of the campaign contributions he made were, in fact, bribes – around 400 million reais. It is still not clear which of these donations were made due to corruptions schemes. Also, since most donations were made through parties, the money might have ended up with a candidate that had nothing to do with the scheme itself. </p>
<p> Since 2006, JBS donated to 28 different political parties, from the left to the right – in fact, of all the official political associations that were involved in those three elections, only four small extreme left-wing parties (PSOL, PSTU, PCB and PCO) did not receive any money from the beef conglomerate. </p>
<p>In 2014, these donations reached 1.988 different candidates – including most of the country’s most important political leaders. Of 27 elected state governors, 16 were financed by JBS. In Congress, the company helped 182 current federal deputies (out of 513) and 12 senators (out of 27) get elected – and they also contributed to 21% of the elected state deputies. </p>
<p>Last, but far from least, they contributed to the three main presidential campaigns. Dilma Rousseff received 74 million reais (£18 million) from JBS, which amounts to 21% of her campaigns earnings. Neves received 30 million (£7 million), 13% of his total budget. Marina Silva, which ran on a third-way platform, received 4.5 million (£1.1 million). </p>
<p>They also contributed to Eduardo Campos, who died in a plane crash before the election and was replaced by Silva, and to Levy Fidélix, an extreme nationalist candidate who received less than 500,000 votes. </p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">JBS: A CASE STUDY</h3>
  <p>Amidst the political crisis in Brazil, company donations became illegal in 2015. The Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) considered that private companies’ contributions provided an unfair advantage to candidates – thus, in most ministers’ interpretation, being unconstitutional. Now, only individuals are allowed to donate – besides that, parties are also entitled to a share of a public fund. </p>
<p>Although it might seem, at first glance, like a simple solution to this corruption problem, it might actually bring many undesired consequences. There’s a fear, expressed by many political leaderships, political scientists and some ministers of the court at the time, that this will result in an increase on illegal payments. Corrupt companies might continue to finance political campaigns in exchange for public benefits, either through proxy donors or simply by paying politicians under the table. </p>
<p>Cervi also points out that, under current trends, there will simply not be enough money to fund the campaigns. Even though the 2010 and 2014 were, in his view, extraordinarily expensive due to an overabundance of private company donations, the money required for travels, campaign ads and all the ordinary costs of a state or national election far exceeds what’s available on public funds. And a culture of individual contributions from regular citizens simply does not exist in the country. </p>
<p>The available data ratifies his view. In 2014, 70% of the campaign was funded by companies, 22% by individuals and 8% by the parties themselves – mostly, from the public political fund. If we dig deeper, the vast majority of individual contributions came from candidates themselves. Only 3% of total donations come from non-candidates. </p>
<p>According to Cervi, amongst the political elites, there is a consensus that this model will not prosper. Nonetheless, they are deeply divided on the options – raising state funding and amending the constitution to allow company donations are amongst the possible outcomes. Also, social reforms proposed by the current government and the political crisis itself seem to occupy all the working hours of the Congress. </p>
